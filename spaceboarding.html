            This is a mobile game where we combined elements from skating and endless running. General idea of this game is that player starts with no extra equipment to assist
            themselves with and gradually as the player collects coins and buys upgrades they get to travel for a longer distance resulting in even more coins and upgrades gained.

            In this project there were only two programmers including myself so my leading job was made pretty easy and it was my first time doing so. Distributing tasks was pretty easy and there was always work 
            to do with this project. We discussed about the important gameplay focused tasks and then started to focus on those as the first thing, growing our backlog with other 
            tasks to be done in the future.
